{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"why-blog","contentHtml":"<p>I ask myself all the time, why do I want a personal website/blog? </p>\n<p>I don't actively post on social media, I never participate in online discussions/forums besides lurking, etc. My accounts sit mainly dormant, with myself only logging in to read what others are up to. I do have social media accounts on twitter and hackernews accounts, but mostly just to read about technology and to inspire my own ideas and creativity.</p>\n<p>If other people are up to cool things, I would want to hear about it, or at the very least have a chance to hear about it. </p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons I am starting this blog. If one day I am working on an interesting problem, that if might inspire others. And if not, thats fine. Learning out in the open, working on my written communication skills, better distillation of complex ideas and information are all equally valuable skills on there own, of which I also hope to hone.</p>\n","title":"Why Blog?","date":"2020-07-12"}},"__N_SSG":true}
